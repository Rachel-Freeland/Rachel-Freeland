### Hi there!! I'm Rachel Freeland
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I spent 20 years in the field of Respiratory Therapy (RT). I never stopped looking around the corner. I started off as a certified RT. After that, I took some classes and met the requirements to challenge the boards for my registry and became a registered RT. After that, I obtained my neonatal/pediatric specialty. Never stop! Always look forward and achieve the next level of your success!!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for work. I will be learning C++ next while continuing to work on my previously earned skills in Python and JS
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently reading ***Atomic Habits: An easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits***
